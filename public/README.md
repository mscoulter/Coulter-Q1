Write-up:

  Colorados 14ers host thousands of hikers every year. With fifty-four 14,000 foot peaks in the state, it can be a difficult task to choose which mountain to tackle on any given trip. With that in mind, this application is designed to allow users to input several filter parameters so as to only review the mountains that fit their search criteria. Because no comprehensive APIs for mountain data were available online, I constructed a JSON object in the data.js containing pertinent 14er data.

  The splash page of the application consists of a form with five input criteria (not counting submit). After submission, the criteria names and values are displayed at the end of the second page's URL, and using .split and regex methods, the criteria values are isolated and assigned to new variables. These variables are compared to their counterpart values from the JSON object using an if statement, and only those mountains that pass each criterion are returned using the jQuery grep method. The address is used to find the latitude and longitude of the user's current location using a Geocoder.geocode method, which initiates a request containing the input to the geocoding service and executes a callback function upon the response. Information from the resulting mountains are stored within Google Maps markers so that when the user clicks on the marker, the most important information is displayed as well as a link to more information!
